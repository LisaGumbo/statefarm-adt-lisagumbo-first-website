        <p name="live_list_description">I was bored in the city of Harare in Zimbabwe and moved to America at the age of 7. 
            The first American city I lived in was Corinth with my family. From then, we moved to Dallas, Carrollton, and Keller. 
            At the age of 18 I moved out of the house and whent to college. I first went to Texas A&M University in Commerce.
             After 1.5 years of college there, I decied to move to University of North Texas in Denton. 
             After college I moved to Plano, TX just 8 mintues away from my job. Currently I back in Carrollton where I bought my first house.</p>
